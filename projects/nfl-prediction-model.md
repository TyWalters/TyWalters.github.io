summary: My first attempt at the FiveThirtyEight NFL forecasting game with publicly available data.
---

There are multiple ways to bet on NFL games, but for my initial model I’m focusing on predicting the straight up winner using probabilities. In the NFL the home team wins 57% of the time. This can serve as a perfect benchmark when predicting the results of games. My predictions should produce results where the accuracy is greater than picking the home team every game (57% of all games correct). There are quite a few models or strategies to predict NFL games, but my attempt was created to be used in FiveThirtyEight’s NFL prediction competition at [NFL Forecasting Game](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nfl-forecasting-game/).
